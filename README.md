# Crop Recommendation System Using PHP

This is a **Crop Recommendation System** developed using **PHP** and **MySQL**. The system provides crop recommendations based on environmental factors such as soil type, temperature, humidity, and rainfall, helping farmers to select the most suitable crop for their region.

## Features

- **User Input Form**: Farmers can enter environmental data such as soil type, temperature, humidity, and rainfall.
- **Crop Recommendation**: The system suggests the best crops based on the entered environmental data.
- **Database Integration**: The system stores the crop data and recommendations in a MySQL database.
- **Admin Panel**: The admin can manage crops, input data, and update recommendations.
  
## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: PHP
- **Database**: MySQL
- **AJAX**: For dynamic data handling without page reloads
- **Web Server**: Apache

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **PHP**: v7.4 or higher
- **MySQL**: v5.7 or higher
- **Apache**: v2.4 or higher (or any web server that supports PHP)
- **XAMPP/WAMP/LAMP**: An all-in-one PHP stack with Apache and MySQL (Optional)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the system locally:

### 1. Clone or Download the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost/Crop-Recommendation-System-Using-PHP`.

### 3. Usage

- **For Admin**: Login to the admin panel (if applicable) to manage crops, update data, and access reports.
- **For Users**: Users can input their environmental data (soil type, temperature, humidity, and rainfall) in the provided form. Based on these inputs, the system will suggest the best crops suited to their region.

### 4. Crop Recommendation Flow
